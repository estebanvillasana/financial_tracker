Personal finance tracker with multi-account support, currency conversion, and internal transfers.

**Stack:** Python · FastAPI · SQLite · Vanilla JS  
**Started:** March 3, 2026

| Date | Decision | File |

| 2026-02-27 | Use Vanilla JS instead of a framework for the frontend | `docs/decisions/26-02-27 Use a JS Framework for Frontend.md` |

## ✅ Phase 1 — Backend (Completed March 5, 2026)

### Database & Schema
- [x] Designed relational schema: `bank_accounts`, `movements`, `categories`, `sub_categories`, `repetitive_movements`
- [x] Soft delete (`active` column) on all tables
- [x] Foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE RESTRICT` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE`
- [x] Composite FK: `(sub_category_id, category_id)` → `sub_categories` to enforce subcategory ownership
- [x] CHECK constraints on `type`, `invoice`, `active` columns
- [x] Indexes for query performance
- [x] Modular schema files: one file per table + separate triggers and indexes
- [x] SQLite triggers for internal transfer naming conventions and validation

### API — FastAPI
- [x] FastAPI app with lifespan management (startup / shutdown hooks)
- [x] Modular router structure: one file per domain
- [x] Pydantic models for all inputs (`CreateRequest`, `UpdateRequest`) and outputs (`Response`)
- [x] Full CRUD for all entities: bank accounts, categories, sub-categories, movements, repetitive movements
- [x] Soft delete endpoints (`PATCH /{id}/soft-delete`) for all entities
- [x] `GET /movements` with rich filtering: account, category, sub-category, type, invoice, date range, movement code, pagination
- [x] `POST /movements/bulk` — atomic bulk insert (all-or-nothing, up to 1000 rows)
- [x] `POST /money-transfers` — atomic paired movements (Expense + Income linked by `movement_code`)
- [x] Full CRUD for money transfers, identified by `movement_code`
- [x] HTTP error handling: 404 for missing records, 409 for FK conflicts on delete, 400 for constraint violations
- [x] `GET /fx-rates` — currency pair conversion with date resolution and fallback logic
- [x] `GET /fx-rates/latest`, `/fx-rates/currencies`, `/fx-rates/all/latest`

### Supporting Systems
- [x] Exchange rates updater script: fetches and stores USD-based rates as monthly JSON files
- [x] Exchange rates auto-update on app startup
- [x] Database backup script with timestamped `.db` copies
- [x] Smart backup on shutdown: skips if last backup is recent enough
- [x] `.gitignore` configured: database file, backups, `.env`, `__pycache__`
- [x] `docs/decisions/` folder for architecture decision records

## 🔲 Phase 2 — Frontend

### Project Setup
- [x] Create `frontend/` directory structure
- [x] `index.html` — single entry point
- [x] `styles/global.css` — CSS variables, reset, typography
- [x] `styles/layout.css` — grid, containers, spacing system
- [x] `config.js` — API base URL (gitignored)
- [x] `services/api.js` — base fetch wrapper (handles errors, base URL, JSON parsing)
  - [x] `services/bankAccountsService.js`
  - [x] `services/movementsService.js`
  - [x] `services/categoriesService.js`
  - [x] `services/transfersService.js`
  - [x] `services/repetitiveMovementsService.js`
  - [x] `services/fxRatesService.js`
  - [x] `services/http.js`

### Create components

#### Dumb
- [x] Side Navigation Menu: shows all the pages so the user can start navigating
- [x] Account Summary Card: simple card that shows the most important info of a bank account
- [ ] Filter Bar
- [ ] Pagination: For the bottom of a table or a list
- [ ] Change main currency selector
#TODO

#### Smart
- [ ] Accounts Summary: Displays all the active bank accounts with a pagination
- [ ] Table to add movements: Based on AG Grids
#TODO

#### Modals
- [ ] Bank account


## Phase 3 — CLI Application

A terminal-based interface for direct database interaction and quick financial queries. This provides an alternative to the frontend GUI for power users who prefer command-line workflows.

### Core Features
- [x] Direct app.db queries through terminal commands
- [x] View all active bank accounts with balances
- [x] Add new transactions/movements interactively
- [x] Reusable query library from `backend/data/explore/`:
- [ ] User-friendly output formatting (tables, summaries)
- [ ] Independent from frontend GUI — runs standalone
